# Python

Python is a programming language supports: OOP Object-Oreinted Programming.

##### What's OOP in layman's term??

We put fields(properties) and methods(functions) together to make a object.

So, that when we have a object, we could use `dot` to access its fields & methods.

##### What's a field/property?

Just a variable with name and better with a type.

It's convinient to group related fields together, like
- Latitude and longitude to define a location on map
- Height and Weight, so we could have BMI
- Mean and Std, so we could have BMI

##### What's a type?

Name two common(built-in) types in python:
- int
- float
- str

##### What's a method(function)?

Sometime could be call with `f(...)`:
- `f` is the function name
  - There is also anonymous function
- `(....)` to pass in arguments
  - position arguments
  - named arguments

```python
def mean(a, b, c = 1, d = 4):
    pass

def std(a, b, c = 1, d = 4):
    pass
```

`a, b` are position arguments

`c, d` are named arguments
- method can also return data
  - Can only return data

What if we need to return multiple data?

The OOP way:
```python
df = load_price("D05")

class MeanSTD():
    mean: float
    std: float

def calcuate(df) -> MeanSTD:
    mean = ...
    std = ...
    return MeanSTD(mean, std)

class DataFrameWithMeanSTD()
    df: DataFrame
    meanSTD: meanSTD

    def __init__(self, df):
        self.df = df
        self.meanSTD = calcuate(df)

df = load_csv(...)
obj = DataFrameWithMeanSTD(df)

# structures could be nested: just `dot` all the way to keep accessing property's property's property's property's...
obj.meanSTD.mean

# Above OOP way is said to be less error-prone than put everything in df, like:
df = load_csv(...)
df["mean"] = ...
df["std"] = ...

# We can't be sure if df has mean / std columns
# but when we have a DataFrameWithMeanSTD obj, we know for sure t has meanSTD field/property
```

#### What's object and class?

Vicky is one(instance) of the students from MSE class.

When we talk about object, usually we mean a specific instances/example of a object

#### How to define a class in python?

`@dataclass` is economist's good friend


```python
@dataclass
class StockPrice:
    ticker: str
    price: float
```

Write the `StockPrice` without `@dataclass`:

```python
class StockPrice:
	pass
```

make
```
sp1 = StockPricc("D05", 26.02)
print(sp1)
```

## Data Structures

### List(vector)

`[1, 2, 3]`

### Dictionary(map)

`{"first_name": "Giovanni", "last_name": "Gao"}`

### Tuple

`()`

## Flow of controls

### indent

```
def hello(name):
print(f"hello {name}")
```

### if/else

### for

```python
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
	print i

d = [i*2 for i in [1, 2, 3]]
```

# Pandas

Just like dataframe in R.

`CSV` is economist's good friend, so what does csv stand for?

RTFM: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

Talk is cheap, show me the code: sgx3000

```python
def load_dividend(ticker: str):
    fname = "data/" + ticker + ".csv"
    df = pd.read_csv(fname)
    df = df[df['Dividends'] > 0]
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.date
    df['Day'] = df['Date'].apply(lambda x: x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
    return df


def load_price(ticker: str):
    fname = "data_latest/" + ticker + ".csv"
    df = pd.read_csv(fname)
    df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.date
    df["Day"] = df['Date'].apply(lambda x: x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
    return df

def load(ticker: str) -> Stock:
    # Load stock info(both price / dividend history) with given ticker
    return Stock(ticker, load_price(ticker), load_dividend(ticker))
```

How to get_return?
